An intranet is a private network used within an organization.
It allows employees to share information, collaborate, and access resources securely.
Intranets often include features like internal websites, communication tools, file sharing, and databases, all designed to enhance productivity and streamline workflows.
Unlike the internet, which is accessible to anyone, an intranet is restricted to authorized users within the organization.
