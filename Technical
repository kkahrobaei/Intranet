An intranet is a private network that helps employees within an organization communicate and share resources.
It uses internet protocols, making it accessible only to authorized users. 
Intranets host applications and documents, providing a secure way for employees to access important information. 
Security measures, like user authentication and access controls, keep sensitive data safe.

In addition to being an information hub, intranets include tools for collaboration, such as wikis and document-sharing platforms, which help teams work together more effectively. 
They can also connect to other internal systems like CRM and ERP, improving overall efficiency.
As organizations grow, intranets are essential for maintaining a connected and productive workplace.
